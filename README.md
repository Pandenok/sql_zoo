# Project: SQL Zoo

## What's this

This is a project in the [Database course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/databases/lessons/sql) at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). This repository contains answers of tutorial given on [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial). I have saved all the approved queries for future reference under a file name that mirrors the challenge section on the web site.

## Build with

My SQL

## Description

SQL Zoo is one of the few resources online that actually lets you build and run queries against existing tables. Each tutorial will show you a table and then have you run queries against it to answer specific questions. Some of the queries, particularly at first, are quite simple. They definitely get more challenging towards the end and can be real head scratchers.

## Reflection

I feel temporarily satisfied and rather comfortable with my level of knowledge of the basics of SQL after these exercises and all the theory in additional resources (Khan Academy's SQL Course, GalaxQl, etc.). Considering also the fact that I wen twice through the tutorial, because I forgot to save my answers.
